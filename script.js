// the user shall input the amount of piles he/she wants on the grid (from 16x16 until 100x100)

// With this input value, calculate width/input to figure out the width of each tile of the grid

// update the value of the width of each div

// create a function that paint a div by clicking on it OR by hovering over it. Once its hovered, the function effect is still valid.
// the function will either: 1. change bg-color of the div; 2. add a class to the div, and this class shall have a different color

// create a clear board function that resets all bg-color or remove the new class of all divs

// add color options to paint brush
